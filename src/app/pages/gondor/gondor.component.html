  <h2>Gondor</h2>

  <p>
    Gondor is one of the most powerful kingdoms established by humans in the west of Middle-earth.
    It was founded by exiles after the fall of NÃºmenor. The White Tree is the symbol of the kingdom
    and is located in the Court of the Fountain in Minas Tirith. In The Lord of the Rings, Gondor is
    at the forefront of the struggle against Sauron and regains its former glory when Aragorn becomes king.
