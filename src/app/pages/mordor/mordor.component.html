  <h2>Mordor</h2>

  <p>
    Mordor is a dark land located in the southeast of Middle-earth, ruled by the Dark Lord Sauron.
    Surrounded by mountains on three sides, this land has a volcanic terrain. The active volcano called Orodruin (Mount
    Doom)
    is located here, and the One Ring was forged in the fires of this mountain. Barad-d√ªr is the most important fortress
    of Mordor,
    and Sauron's eye watches over Middle-earth from here.
