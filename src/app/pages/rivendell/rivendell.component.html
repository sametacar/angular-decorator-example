  <h2>Rivendell</h2>

  <p>
    Rivendell (Imladris in Elvish) is an elven settlement located in the north of Middle-earth, at the foothills of the
    Misty Mountains.
    Founded by Elrond in the Second Age, this valley serves as both a sanctuary and a house of wisdom. The Fellowship of
    the Ring was formed
    here in The Lord of the Rings. Rivendell is famous for its healing powers, libraries, and works of art. Its
    architecture is designed
    in harmony with nature, surrounded by waterfalls and gardens.
